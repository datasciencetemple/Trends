# Google Trends and Stock Volume 

This project, initiated by the Data Science Department of Temple University, aims to explore the intricate relationship between stock trading volumes and trends in Google search data. Our investigation delves into analyzing patterns and correlations between search interest for specific stock-related terms and the trading volumes of those stocks. Through this research, we aim to uncover insights that could be invaluable for academic researchers and investors.

An interesting data feature discovered by our team highlights a significant link between Google Trends data and stock market activities. This finding has propelled us to conduct preliminary research to further understand the dynamics at play. We are excited to share our initial findings here, with the hope of fostering future research and collaboration.

The preliminary results are updated to this GitHub repository every weekday morning, reflecting our ongoing commitment to transparency and academic sharing. We believe that by making our research accessible, we can encourage a collaborative environment where scholars and practitioners alike can contribute to and benefit from our findings.
