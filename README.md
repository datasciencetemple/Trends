# Google Trends and Trading Volume 

This project aims to explore the relationship between stock trading volumes and trends in Google search data. By analyzing patterns and correlations between search interest for specific stock-related terms and the trading volumes of those stocks, we aim to uncover insights that could be valuable for traders, investors, and researchers alike.

This is a pure academic research project, and we welcome collaboration from anyone interested in this field. The preliminary results are updated to this GitHub repository every work day morning.
